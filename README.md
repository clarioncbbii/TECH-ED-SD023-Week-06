<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project. -->

# REFLECTION

Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

## REQUIRED

#### What requirements did you achieve?

....

#### Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

...

#### If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

Changing my rationale from vanilla JS to react JSX has been a journey of learning to walk by falling. It is very different to what I had only just become accustomed to.

## OPTIONAL

#### Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

This assignment was HARD for me. Not because it was technically more challenging that the cookie clicker, guestbook, or group project. But because React is so foreign to me. The intensity of the course and volume of content is becoming difficult to manage day-in-day-out.

#### Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

As usual, any insights in the quality of my folder and code structure would be appreciated. My command of React at this stage feels like 'floundering fish on a beach, in summer' as I described it to Bertie. (LOL)

#### What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?

Bertie's help on understanding how to get the next and previous buttons working was instrumental. Especially bc when I did this same gallery for my week 2 assignment in vanilla JS, I could not get my buttons working. He drew me a pictogram to explaining the concept of looping through the thumbnail images and with much difficulty (on my part) got me to understand it. I really appreciated the support.

#### What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

The first time I tried using the Unsplash API it absolutely bombed and I scrapped the entire thing and started again with the week 6 API.
I solved that first trainwreck simply by listening to Tim who told me to get it working with the basic API first and once I am happy with it, to then reattempt the Unsplash API.

#### What went really well and what could have gone better?

For React, everything from events onwards was a bit of a blur for me - too much new terminology, a lot of mixing up logic from vanilla JS and general adaptation pains. I think what would have helped is to have revised the demos a lot more before starting work on the assignment and addressing each workshop.
I basically went in headlong bc I did not want to lose time on revision, and chose to instead just get help along the way to fill my gaps. I worry for the next week to be honest, but we'll see how it goes. I have been resolved to taking evenings off so I am not burnt out come the next morning and I think I will keep it as such.
